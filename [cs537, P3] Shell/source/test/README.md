# TO STUDENTS

This is the testing framework for project 3

## Usage

To use this framework, first put your code onto a wisc CSL machine.

To list the set of public tests, please do:

```bash
~cs537-1/tests/p3/list-tests.sh
```

To run the tests, use the command at the path that contains your source files:

```bash
~cs537-1/tests/p3/run-tests.sh
```
Your makefile's default rule should build the mysh program.

Passing all public cases does not guarantee full credit for this assignment. 20% of test cases are hidden, so make sure your code is robust so that you pass all the hidden test cases as well. These hidden test cases are not made to trick your code--they are straightforward.
