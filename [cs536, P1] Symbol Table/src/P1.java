/**
   * To test your SymTable implementation, you will write a main program in a file named P1.java. The program must not expect any command-line arguments or user input. It can read from one or more files; if you set it up to do that, be sure to hand in the file(s) along with P1.java.

  Be sure that your P1.java tests all of the Sym and SymTable operations and all situations under which exceptions are thrown. Also think about testing both “boundary” and “non-boundary” cases.

  It is up to you how your program works. A suggested approach is to write your program so that output is only produced if one of the methods that it is testing does not work as expected (e.g., if the lookupLocal method of the SymTable class returns null when you expect it to return a non-null value). This will make it much easier to determine whether your test succeeds or fails. The one exception to this approach is that P1.java will need to test the print method of the SymTable class and that will cause output to be produced.
