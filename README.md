Software Engineering field:
_includes:_
  - Theoretical knowledge in computer science, including mathematics (Reasoning with abstraction, logic, & patterns) .
  - Software developemnt - usage of tools & programming/coding solutions optimally & maintenably. 
  - Research & integration with existing services/solutions.
  - Management of project & Coordination of team - effectively planning/tracking/managing work (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance).
  - Communication skills.
  - Continual learning ability & gaining experience.
  - Other entrepreneurial skills: product management, knowing/understanding/identifying end-user/stakeholders requirements, adaptation to changing & different markets, revenue-cost control, etc.

_(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design#Software_development)[Approaches/paths to get into the field:]_
- Theoretical approach: aquiring theoretical knowledge in computer science & mathematics first, followed by subsequent practicing and transcribing conceptual solutions into code. **- defenitely a better approach.**
- Practical approach: studying programming (learning to code) & gaining hands-on experience, developing more theoretical knowledge usually when required (bottom-up approch). 

Self-studing: in this day and age, studying CS deeply in advanced level is easier than ever. All material from courses, books, articles, career mentorship & advices, examples & exercises, etc. is available electronically. 
The only issue with that approach is that it will take you some time to become oriented regarding:
- Finding and filtering the right resources/books/courses,
