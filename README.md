Interview theoretical &amp; coding problems, CS coursework / assignments [mainly of UW-Madison CS department]

## Software Engineering field:

_includes:_
  - Theoretical knowledge in computer science, including mathematics (Reasoning with abstraction, logic, & patterns) .
  - Software developemnt - usage of tools & programming/coding solutions optimally & maintenably. 
  - Research & integration with existing services/solutions.
  - Management of project & Coordination of team - effectively planning/tracking/managing work (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance).
  - Communication skills.
  - Continual learning ability & gaining experience.
  - Other entrepreneurial skills: product management, knowing/understanding/identifying end-user/stakeholders requirements, adaptation to changing & different markets, revenue-cost control, etc.


_Approaches/paths to get into the field: [(top-down and bottom-up approaches)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design#Software_development)_
- Theoretical approach: aquiring theoretical knowledge in computer science & mathematics first, followed by subsequent practicing and transcribing conceptual solutions into code. **- defenitely a better approach.**
- Practical approach: studying programming (learning to code) & gaining hands-on experience, developing more theoretical knowledge usually when required (bottom-up approch). 


## Self-studing:
In this day and age, studying CS deeply in an advanced level is easier than ever. All the material needed from courses, books, articles, career mentorship & advices, examples & exercises, etc. is available electronically. 


The only issue with that approach is that it will take you some time to become oriented regarding:
- Understanding the classification of CS & Math fields and how each relate to the other (e.g. the different areas tought in university level courses).
- Finding and filtering the right resources/books/courses, taking into consideration the benifit gain in relation to the time cost _(cost-benifit analysis ?)_.
- Managing & tracking the study plan over long period of time. 
- Organizing and taking notes for the vast amount of information gained.
- Researching and exploring the right study fields, in addition to choosing the right technologies, as changing to a completely different stack ecosystem is very time consuming. Gaining that ability to know when to switch and what to choose doesn't come easy.


Some tools useful for studying: 
- Trello as study board planning & tracking exercises/work - listing active and future resources to study from: books, courses, videos/playlists, articles, pratice & code challege sites, news followup, etc.
[Example](https://trello.com/b/FDn5rABz)
- Microsoft OneNote as a note taking electronic notebook - Summerizing the information of different topics, and listing resources & tools in each field. The reason that OneNote is superior to other solutions is because it allows to store all the files and data locally (i.e. not locked & dependent on an online service).
[Example](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aj6AhOSNgvUOqWiQ3YOKkSBHOIsd)
- Miro as fields orientation & tech stack classification - i.e. it allows to create graphs to organize the different study fields in CS and Math for example, or classify the different tools used in software development for each of the fields.
[Example](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kuMxGbo=/)
- Drawing tablet (e.g. Wacom Intous Pro) with Microsoft OneNote & Microsoft Whiteboard: for complete electronic note taking and practicing during studying CS or Math.
- Git repositories for practicing exercises or documenting software related tools and local environment setup.
etc.
