# Assignment TODO:

-   C programming considerations:
-   A screenshot showing the output of my-rev piped as the input of my-look
    So, as a final step, use your two new utilities to look for a string in the reversed dictionary; that is, show that you can pipe the output of my-rev as the input to my-look with /usr/share/dict/words as the original input file. You can look for any string that you think shows that the basic functionality is working (i.e., don't pick a palindrome -- a word that is the same forwards and backwards).
    Once you have an example from one of the machines in the instructional cluster, take a screenshot and upload that screenshot to Canvas as part of this assignment. Your screenshot should clearly show your shell command and the relevant output. Your screenshot should also show the output of running the commands hostname and whoami.
    Upload your screenshot of piping to this assignment in Canvas, as a single image file in any image format.
